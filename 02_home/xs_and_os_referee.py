"""
Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.

But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".
Example:
	checkio([
	    "X.O",
	    "XX.",
	    "XOO"]) == "X"
	checkio([
	    "OO.",
	    "XOX",
	    "XOX"]) == "O"
	checkio([
	    "OOX",
	    "XXO",
	    "OXX"]) == "D"
